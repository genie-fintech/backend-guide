In our team, we frequently engage in discussions to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of individual programming preferences held by our members. Once we reach a consensus, we document our agreed-upon approach in guidelines, along with the rationale behind our decision.

We perceive our guidelines as a dynamic document, recognizing that people, teams, and perspectives evolve over time. Rather than rigidly adhering to past rules, we continuously question and challenge them. Our guidelines are subject to refinement based on new experiences, ultimately resulting in updated and enhanced recommendations.
